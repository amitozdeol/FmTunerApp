This is the README for the ivtv module suite.

----------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This driver will work with kernels 2.6.18, 2.6.19, 2.6.20.2 (or up) and 2.6.21.
Kernels 2.6.20 and 2.6.20.1 should not be used due to a bug in the cx25840 firmware
loading routine.


NOTE: This driver does not support kernel 2.6.22 and up: starting with that kernel
version ivtv will be part of the kernel itself.


NOTE: this driver requires the latest encoder firmware (version 2.06.039, size
376836 bytes). Get the firmware from here:

http://dl.ivtvdriver.org/ivtv/firmware/firmware.tar.gz


NOTE: When you build your own kernel, make sure you have enabled all the correct
modules. For 2.6.18: make sure you have enabled all modules in Device Drivers,
Multimedia devices, Video Capture Adapters, Encoders and Decoders.
Especially the new 'Conexant CX2341x MPEG encoders' entry.

For 2.6.19/20/21: In Device Drivers, Multimedia devices, Video Capture Adapters disable
the 'Autoselect pertinent encoders/decoders and other helper chips' option, then go
to the 'Encoders/decoders and other helper chips' entry that appeared.
It is probably easiest to just select all modules here, unless you know exactly
which chips your card has. One exception: I recommend that you do not enable the
Philips SAA7114 video encoder, use 'Philips SAA7113/4/5 video decoders' instead.


NOTE: ivtv-fb (PVR350 specific) now requires that you enable the following kernel
config options: Go to 'Device drivers -> Graphics support'. Enable 'Support for frame
buffer devices'. Enable 'Trident support' (the Trident module itself is not required).

To get working console output, keep going to 'Console display driver support', 
and enable 'Framebuffer Console support'. Enable 'Select compiled-in fonts' & 
once that's done, you should have a list of fonts. Choose one. With the 
default OSD size, 'VGA 8x16' gives 80x30(PAL) 80x25(NTSC).


NOTE: users of MythTV who use the PVR350 for mpeg decoding need to specify
the option osd_compat=1 when loading the ivtv-fb module. This is not required
when using the default Xv output.


NOTE: users of ivtv X driver may need to specify the option
osd_compat=1 when loading the ivtv-fb module. You will only need it if the
display becomes scrambled in X.


NOTE: see README.v4l-dvb if you need to build ivtv as part of the latest v4l-dvb
repository. If you don't know what this is all about, then you don't need this :-)

----------------------------------------------------------

The primary goal of the IVTV project is to provide a "clean room" Linux 
Open Source driver implementation for video capture cards based on the 
iCompression iTVC15 or Conexant CX23415/CX23416 MPEG Codec.

The following cards are supported:

Hauppauge WinTV PVR-250
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-500
AVerMedia M179
Yuan MPG600/Kuroutoshikou iTVC16-STVLP
Yuan MPG160/Kuroutoshikou iTVC15-STVLP
Yuan PG600/DiamondMM PVR-550 (CX Falcon 2)
Adaptec AVC-2410
Adaptec AVC-2010
Nagase Transgear 5000TV
AOpen VA2000MAX-STN6
Yuan MPG600GR/Kuroutoshikou CX23416GYC-STVLP
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX2E
Gotview PCI DVD (preliminary support only)
Gotview PCI DVD2 Deluxe
Yuan MPC622
Digital Cowboy DCT-MTVP1
Yuan PG600V2/GotView PCI DVD Lite (no tuner support)
Club3D ZAP-TV1x01 (no tuner support)
AverTV MCE 116 Plus (no tuner support)

A special note regarding the PVR-500: this card basically consists of two
PVR-150 cards on one board but with the following difference: Radio,
Composite video and S-video are only hooked up to the first PVR-150 instance.

The Hauppauge cable set that you can buy for their cards to add an additional
Composite/S-Video input is also supported.

Features:
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of broadcast video (and sound) via the tuner or
   S-Video/Composite and audio line-in.
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of FM radio where hardware support exists
 * Supports NTSC, PAL, SECAM with stereo sound
 * Supports SAP and bilingual transmissions.
 * Supports raw VBI (closed captions and teletext).
 * Supports raw YUV and PCM input.

Additional features for the PVR-350 (CX23415 based):
 * Provides hardware mpeg2 playback
 * Provides comprehensive OSD (On Screen Display: ie. graphics overlaying the
   video signal)
 * Provides a framebuffer (allowing X applications to appear on the video
   device)
 * Supports raw YUV output.

Note: the old sourceforge ivtv project is no longer active and will
redirect to ivtvdriver.org. All development now takes place in the
subversion repository on ivtvdriver.org.
